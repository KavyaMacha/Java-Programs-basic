This collection of Java programs covers fundamental concepts including string manipulation, array handling, and sorting algorithms. It includes programs for tasks such as:

String manipulation: Programs to perform operations like string concatenation, substring extraction, and string comparison.

Array handling: Programs demonstrating array initialization, traversal, searching, and modification.

Sorting algorithms: Implementation of sorting algorithms such as bubble sort, selection sort, and insertion sort to arrange elements in ascending or descending order.

These programs serve as a foundation for understanding core Java concepts and are essential for beginners to practice and grasp key programming techniques.
